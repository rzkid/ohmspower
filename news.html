Reports indicate that the invading creatures are more akin to aggressive alien wildlife than a well-organized force, attacking without warning and seemingly at random.

Meanwhile, portal storms are ravaging the world, leaving many to speculate about the aliens' ultimate goal. Citizens live in constant fear, uncertain of when and where the creatures will strike next, and hoping that the military can protect them from the unknown threat. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance as the world watches to see if the military can stop the alien invasion and the portal storms before it's too late.</p></div>
